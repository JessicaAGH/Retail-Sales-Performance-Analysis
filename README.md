# 🛍 Retail Sales Performance Analysis
## 📌 Project Description

This project analyzes retail sales data from 2018 to 2021 to evaluate business performance across regions, product categories, sales channels, and customer segments. Using Power BI, the dataset was transformed into interactive dashboards that provide insights into revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), profitability, and operational efficiency.

The goal was to convert raw transactional data into strategic insights that support smarter, data-driven business decisions.


## 🎯 Project Goals

- Measure overall sales, profit, and order performance  
- Identify high-performing regions and countries  
- Analyze product category profitability  
- Evaluate retailer channel effectiveness  
- Track time-based sales and margin trends  
- Detect return patterns and operational gaps  
- Support strategic growth and cost optimization decisions


## 📂 Data Sources
The dataset includes:
- Retail transactional sales dataset (2018–2021)  
- Order-level data (Order Quantity, Sales Amount, COGS, Profit)  
- Product data (Category, Size, Gender)  
- Geographic data (Country, Area)  
- Retailer channel data (Franchise, Local Store, Supermarket, Small Chain Store)


## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Microsoft Power BI  
- Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)  
    - DAX (Calculated Measures & KPIs)  
    - Data Modeling (Relationships)  
- Data Visualization & Dashboard Design  
- KPI Tracking & Time Series Analysis


## 📊 Overview
- 8,391 Total Orders  
- 548 Returned Orders  
- £3.8M Total Profit  
- England generated the highest retail performance  
- Sales, profit, COGS tracked monthly and quarterly (2018–2021)  


## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Revenue vs COGS comparison  
- Profit and average profit margin over time  
- Sales by area and country
- Geographic sales distribution (map visualization)   
- Channel-based performance  
- Category-based revenue contribution  
- Size and gender order distribution
- Cross-filtering and drill-down interactivity  


## 🔎 Key Insights
### 1️⃣ Geographic Performance
- England contributed the majority of order quantity (approx. 88%)  
- Certain regions such as South East showed stronger revenue concentration  

### 2️⃣ Channel Performance 
- Local stores and franchises generated significant order quantities  
- Some channels showed higher volume but lower profit margins, indicating cost inefficiencies  

### 3️⃣ Product Category Insights
- Hoodies & Sweatshirts and Jackets generated strong revenue  
- Profitability varied across categories despite similar sales volume  
- Some lower-selling categories maintained healthier margins  

### 4️⃣ Time-Based Trends 
- Revenue and profit showed seasonal fluctuations  
- Profit margins remained relatively stable across quarters  
- Monthly revenue trends indicate recurring peak sales periods  

### 5️⃣ Size & Gender Analysis
- Medium (M) and Large (L) sizes had the highest order volume  
- Men's products generated a slightly higher share of orders  

### 6️⃣ Returns Analysis
- 548 returned orders highlight potential issues in product satisfaction, sizing, or logistics


## 💡 Recommendations / Solutions

- Focus marketing investment on high-performing regions (especially England)  
- Optimize pricing strategies for low-margin categories  
- Investigate causes of returned orders (size issues, product quality, shipping delays)  
- Expand inventory for high-demand sizes (such as XL,M,L)  
- Improve cost control in high-volume but low-margin channels  
- Leverage seasonal trends for promotional planning  
- Strengthen profitable product categories with targeted campaigns


## 💼 Business Impact

This dashboard enables:
- Clear visibility into profitability drivers  
- Faster executive-level decision-making  
- Identification of cost inefficiencies  
- Data-backed growth strategy development  

The project demonstrates advanced Power BI skills, including DAX calculations, time intelligence modeling, data architecture design, and business-focused analytics.

## 🏁 Final Note

This project demonstrates how structured data analysis can transform raw retail data into strategic business intelligence. By leveraging Power BI’s analytical and visualization capabilities, the dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor performance, identify growth opportunities, and make proactive, data-driven decisions.  

The analysis highlights the importance of understanding not just revenue, but profitability, cost efficiency, and operational performance in building a sustainable retail strategy.
